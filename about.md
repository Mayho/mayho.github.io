## Hi I'm Mehul!

I'm a 25 year old software engineer from Georgia that has recently relocated to San Francisco. I'm currently attending [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com), a super intense coding bootcamp that focuses on javascript. I'm really intereted in mobile web application development, as I feel the line between what can be done with native mobile apps and web apps is getting blurrier everyday.

On another note, I play fighting games competitively. The main game I compete in is [Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkeKkrxoT8M). You should def hit me up if you'd like to go a few rounds.
